## Core Concepts

### Graphs

Operations are composed as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs):

```
Noise -> Threshold -> Displace
              ↓
           Sphere -> Output
```

Evaluation is lazy - the graph is a description, computed on demand.

### Attributes

Data attached to geometric elements:
- Per-vertex: position, normal, UV, color
- Per-edge: crease, seam
- Per-face: material ID, smooth group

Attributes flow through operations, transformed as appropriate.

### Parameters

All operations expose parameters:
- Scalar values
- Expressions (computed at evaluation time)
- Animated values (function of time)
- Data-driven (from external sources)

## Why glam?

We use `glam` for math types (Vec2, Vec3, Quat, Mat4, etc.) because:

- **Bevy compatible**: bevy uses glam internally, so types work directly without conversion
- **Pure Rust**: no C dependencies, easy cross-compilation
- **SIMD optimized**: good performance on supported platforms
- **Minimal**: does one thing well, few dependencies

Alternatives considered:
- `nalgebra`: more features but heavier, different API than bevy
- `ultraviolet`: similar to glam but less ecosystem adoption
- `cgmath`: older, less maintained

## Bevy Integration

Types implement standard conversion traits:

```rust
// resin mesh -> bevy mesh
let bevy_mesh: bevy::render::mesh::Mesh = resin_mesh.into();

// glam types used directly (shared with bevy)
let pos: glam::Vec3 = vertex.position;
```

No bevy dependency in core - conversions live in optional feature flags or adapter crates.
