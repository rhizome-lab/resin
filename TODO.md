# TODO

## Next Up

- [x] Path constraints (bones follow curves) — sample curve, orient bone tangent
- [x] Morph targets / blend shapes — vertex deltas + weight blending
- [x] Animation clips and tracks — keyframes, interpolation, property tracks
- [x] IK solvers (CCD, FABRIK) — iterative chain solving
- [x] Subdivision surfaces — Loop subdivision (Catmull-Clark needs quad mesh)

## Backlog

- [ ] Bevy integration examples
- [x] Expression language parser (expr::Expr)
- [x] Basic texture nodes (Checkerboard, Voronoi, Stripes, Brick, Dots, SDFs)
- [x] Audio effects/filters (LowPass, HighPass, Biquad, Delay, FeedbackDelay)
- [x] Skeleton/bone types
- [x] Derive macro for DynNode
- [x] Field<I, O> trait for lazy evaluation
- [x] Noise functions (Perlin, Simplex)
- [x] Basic oscillators
- [x] 2D path primitives
- [x] Implement basic mesh primitives (box, sphere)
- [x] Set up graph evaluation system
- [x] Define attribute traits
- [x] Review all design decisions for consistency, extract patterns/philosophy to docs/philosophy.md
