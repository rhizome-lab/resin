### File Formats

> **Out of scope.** Complex file formats (FBX, USD, Alembic, video) are [Cambium](https://github.com/rhizome-lab/cambium)'s responsibility. Resin focuses on generation and manipulation, not I/O for proprietary formats.

### Polish

- [ ] Examples - usage examples for key crates
- [ ] Benchmarks - performance baselines for critical paths
- [ ] Integration tests - cross-crate workflows

### Graph Serialization

> **Status: Not implemented.** The graph system (`resin-core`) and audio chain (`resin-audio`) use trait objects (`Box<dyn DynNode>`, `Box<dyn AudioNode>`) which can't be directly serialized. Full serialization would require:
> - Serde derives on `Value`, `ValueType`, `Edge`
> - Node registry mapping `type_name()` → constructor
> - Parameter extraction from nodes
> - Complete `Value` enum (currently missing Image, Mesh, Field, etc.)

### Post-Features

- [x] Documentation pass - comprehensive docs for all new features
- [x] Test coverage pass - tests for all new features
- [x] Architecture review - evaluate patterns, identify inconsistencies (see docs/architecture-review.md)
- [x] Refactoring - HIGH: tuple returns → named structs, panics → Option; MEDIUM: collision dedup, missing traits, step() split
