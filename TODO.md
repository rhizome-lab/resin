# TODO

## Next Up

- [ ] Quad mesh / half-edge representation (for Catmull-Clark, bevel)
- [ ] Texture mapping (UV projection)
- [ ] Spline / curve types (Bezier, Catmull-Rom)

## Backlog

- [ ] Bevy integration examples
- [ ] NURBS / B-spline curves
- [ ] GPU compute backend for fields

## Done

- [x] Mesh ops (extrude, inset, solidify, weld, flip)
- [x] Particle system (emitters, forces, turbulence)
- [x] Path constraints (bones follow curves)
- [x] Morph targets / blend shapes
- [x] Animation clips and tracks
- [x] IK solvers (CCD, FABRIK)
- [x] Subdivision surfaces (Loop)
- [x] SDF operations (smooth union, intersection, subtraction)
- [x] Domain modifiers (twist, bend, repeat, mirror)
- [x] Envelope generators (ADSR, AR, LFO)
- [x] Expression language parser (expr::Expr)
- [x] Basic texture nodes (Checkerboard, Voronoi, Stripes, Brick, Dots, SDFs)
- [x] Audio effects/filters (LowPass, HighPass, Biquad, Delay, FeedbackDelay)
- [x] Skeleton/bone types
- [x] Derive macro for DynNode
- [x] Field<I, O> trait for lazy evaluation
- [x] Noise functions (Perlin, Simplex)
- [x] Basic oscillators
- [x] 2D path primitives
- [x] Implement basic mesh primitives (box, sphere)
- [x] Set up graph evaluation system
- [x] Define attribute traits
- [x] Review all design decisions for consistency, extract patterns/philosophy to docs/philosophy.md
