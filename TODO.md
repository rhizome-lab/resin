# TODO

## Next Up

## Backlog

### Procedural / Simulation
- [ ] Rigid body physics - collision detection, constraints, stacking

### Audio
(all done!)

### File Formats

> **Note:** These need serious design consideration. May be better handled by [Cambium](https://github.com/rhizome-lab/cambium) (pipeline orchestrator for data conversion).

- [ ] FBX import - proprietary, complex; may need external lib or Cambium
- [ ] USD import/export - massive spec; likely needs OpenUSD bindings or Cambium
- [ ] Alembic import/export - cached geometry/animation; C++ lib with Rust bindings exists

### Export / Rendering
- [ ] Video export - mp4/webm encoding (likely via external tool/ffmpeg)
