# TODO

## Next Up

## Backlog

### Procedural / Simulation
- [ ] Voxels - voxel grids, SDF → voxel conversion, voxel editing, sparse storage
- [ ] Point clouds - sampling from meshes/SDFs, reconstruction, filtering, normals estimation
- [ ] Texture baking - render Field → Image at UV coords, lightmap baking
- [ ] Fluid simulation - SPH, grid-based, 2D/3D
- [ ] Smoke/gas simulation - density advection, buoyancy
- [ ] Rigid body physics - collision detection, constraints, stacking

### Audio
- [ ] Spectral processing - FFT, STFT, spectral filtering, pitch detection
- [ ] Vocoder - analysis/synthesis, cross-synthesis
- [ ] Physical modeling (percussion) - membranes, bars, plates

### File Formats

> **Note:** These need serious design consideration. May be better handled by [Cambium](https://github.com/rhizome-lab/cambium) (pipeline orchestrator for data conversion).

- [ ] FBX import - proprietary, complex; may need external lib or Cambium
- [ ] USD import/export - massive spec; likely needs OpenUSD bindings or Cambium
- [ ] Alembic import/export - cached geometry/animation; C++ lib with Rust bindings exists

### Export / Rendering
- [ ] Animation export - image sequences, GIF encoding
- [ ] Video export - mp4/webm encoding (likely via external tool/ffmpeg)
